## Microeconometrics Project: High-Dimensional Methods and Inference on Structural and Treatment Effects
The [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/HumanCapitalAnalysis/microeconometrics-course-project-satwikav/blob/master/replication_vysetty.ipynb) in this repository replicates results of the [article](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/jep.28.2.29): 
*Belloni, Alexandre and Chernozhukov, Victor and Hansen, Christian. 2014. "High-Dimensional Methods and Inference on Structural and Treatment Effects." Journal of Economic Perspectives, 28 (2): 29-50.*
#### **Article summary**
<p align="justify">
Belloni et al. (2014) in their paper explain the use of data mining techniques for high-quality inference. Machine learning techniques perform well for predictions but may lead to incorrect conclusions when it comes to inference. In cases of high-dimensionality, researcher is faced with the problem of selecting controls or selecting instruments which could possibly lead to endogeneity if any relevant variables are excluded.  Given such a scenario, in their paper, they suggest using a model section technique called LASSO (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator) for better inference of model parameters. In the first part of their paper, they explain when and how can LASSO be used and in the second part, they examine three empirical examples where they implement LASSO and compare the results to the respective baseline models.

#### **Replication summary**
<p align="justify">
The authors used STATA for their empirical analysis. The replication of this paper is done in Python using Jupyter Notebook. As mentioned previously, the authors use three empirical examples where they implement their method (LASSO) and compare their results to the baseline regressions. I have replicated the results of basline regression as well as regression that implements authors' method for each of the three examples discussed in the paper. In the first bit of my notebook, I explain what is high-dimensional data, why there is a need to regularise and how to implement the authors' idea. Authors present three different scenarios through the examples they have used. In the first example, the scenario is model selection where there are too many instruments. In the second example, the scenario is model selection where there are too many controls. In the third example, the scenario is model selection where there are too many controls in case of an instrumental variable approach.
