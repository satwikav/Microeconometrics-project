#### **Abstract**
<p align="justify">
Belloni et al. (2014) in their paper explain the use of data mining techniques for high-quality inference. Machine learning techniques perform well for predictions but may lead to incorrect conclusions when it comes to inference. In cases of high-dimensionality, researcher is faced with the problem of selecting controls or selecting instruments which could possibly lead to endogeneity if any relevant variables are excluded.  Given such a scenario, in their paper, they suggest using a model section technique called LASSO (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator) for better inference of model parameters. In the first part of their paper, they explain when and how can LASSO be used and in the second part, they examine three empirical examples where they implement LASSO and compare the results to the respective baseline models.
